        the year <br />
        1859 by Sri Kandukuri Venkata Ramayya during the time of Nizam
        VI <br />
        Mir Mahboob Ali Khan.
        Kandukuri Venkata Ramayya was richest baniya during the time
        of Nizam. <br />
        As there was untouchability prevailing during the times,
        Dalits were not <br />
        allowed to enter the temple. In order to provide entry for
        devotees of all <br />
        communities into the temple, the temple was constructed by his
        own money <br />
        without collecting funds from anyone. During the time of
        construction, <br />
        there were many hurdles created by Nizam government in order
        to stop the <br />
        construction of temple. As the Razakars used to demolish the
        temple in the <br />
        day time, the construction used to take place during the night
        time. As this <br />
        continues for few days, Lord Shiva appeared in the dream of
        Kandukuri <br />
        Venkata Ramayya and said “Do not fear constructing my temple.
        Continue <br />
        constructing the temple during day time without any fear”.
        Temple was almost <br /> completed and Nizam army handcuffed Venkata Ramayya and tried
        to take him into the prison. Immediately the handcuffs turned
        to flower garland. `,
