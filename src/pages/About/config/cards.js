        devotees of all 
        communities into the temple, the temple was constructed by his
        own money 
        without collecting funds from anyone. During the time of
        construction,
        there were many hurdles created by Nizam government in order
        to stop the
        construction of temple. As the Razakars used to demolish the

        time. As this
